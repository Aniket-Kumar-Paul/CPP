This list consists of all the important or new approaches/questions, algorithms learnt till now .

1. Making an extra array for storing indexes
2. Check_array[containing Boolean values] approach
3. Sliding Window/Two pointer approach
4. Kadane's Algorithm - for finding max subarray sum, Whenever,we get a negative sum we initialize the sum to 0 again
5. Max Circular Subarray Sum

9. Recursion - last wala chahiye then call pehle and vice-versa
10. Recursion - shorten the string/array in each call
11. Backtracking
